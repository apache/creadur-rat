How to build RAT
================

There is a Maven default goal configured that builds and installs a fresh artifact. Just launch Maven without any goals in the project root directory.

Normal development:

    mvn install OR 
    ./mvnw install 

Normal development without running tests:

    mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true install OR
    ./mvnw -Dmaven.test.skip=true install

Build apache release

    mvn clean install -Papache-release OR
    ./mvnw clean install -Papache-release

RAT uses the previous release version during the build to verify it complies its own rules.
