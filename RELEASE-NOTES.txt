              Apache Creadur Rat 0.12
                  RELEASE NOTES

The Apache Creadur Rat team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Creadur Rat 0.12

Apache Rat is a release audit tool. It improves accuracy and efficiency when checking
releases. It is heuristic in nature: making guesses about possible problems. It
will produce false positives and cannot find every possible issue with a release.
Its reports require interpretation.

In response to demands from project quality tool developers, Rat is available as a
library suitable for inclusion in tools. This POM describes that library.
Note that binary compatibility is not guaranteed between 0.x releases.

Apache Rat is developed by the Apache Creadur project, a language and build
agnostic home for software distribution comprehension and audit tools.

We now require Maven 3.0.5+ to build Rat, but as before we only require
Maven 2.2.1+ if you want to use Rat in your own Maven projects.
We've integrated Rat into the ASF Jenkins to ensure continuous builds with various JDK versions.

Changes in this version include:

o RAT-196:  Minor refactoring in pom.xml. Thanks to Karl Heinz Marbais.
