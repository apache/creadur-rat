              Apache Creadur Rat 0.16
                  RELEASE NOTES

The Apache Creadur Rat team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Creadur Rat 0.16

Apache Rat is a release audit tool. It improves accuracy and efficiency when checking
releases. It is heuristic in nature: making guesses about possible problems. It
will produce false positives and cannot find every possible issue with a release.
Its reports require interpretation.

In response to demands from project quality tool developers, Rat is available as a
library suitable for inclusion in tools. This POM describes that library.
Note that binary compatibility is not guaranteed between 0.x releases.

Apache Rat is developed by the Apache Creadur project, a language and build
agnostic home for software distribution comprehension and audit tools.

Apart from dependency updates and multiple bugfixes, this release brings the ability to use SPDX license identifiers and enhances the .gitignore-exclusion filterung during RAT runs.
Furthermore new CLI options were added and new file types can be used by default. This release makes RAT a fully Maven3-compatible plugin and removes deprecated Maven2 completely.
Thanks to all new contributors for improving RAT!

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o RAT-338:  Update minimal build Maven version to 3.2.5 and maven dependencies to 3.9.6. Remove pre-JDK8 code constructs and minor refactorings. Thanks to Tamás Cservenák.
o RAT-335:  Enhance .gitignore handling; support multiple .gitignore files and allow a more complete parsing of Git's ignore files. Thanks to Niels Basjes.
o RAT-322:  Add configuration option to scan hidden directories: --scan-hidden-directories on the command line and scanHiddenDirectories as a Maven plugin parameter. Thanks to Jean-Baptiste Onofré.
o RAT-320:  Add new command line option -o/--output to write RAT's output to a file. Thanks to Jean-Baptiste Onofré.
o RAT-329:  Add markdown (MD) and yaml (YML/YAML) as a recognized extension for file and license processing. Thanks to Claude Warren.
o RAT-316:  Add default exclusion of MANIFEST.MF as it must not contain comment lines to include a license.
o RAT-321:  Allow text-based XML configuration of RAT. Thanks to Claude Warren.

Fixed Bugs:
o RAT-326:  Fix existing javadoc build errors and add javadoc generation to existing GithubActions to not introduce build errors via merge requests.
o RAT-328:  Ensure that System.out does not get closed during report generation and updated javadocs. Thanks to Claude Warren.
o RAT-311:  Update commons-compress to 1.24.0 in order to circumvent CVE-2023-42503.
o RAT-251:  Added SPDX processing for default licenses. Thanks to Claude Warren.
o RAT-315:  Fix warnings when using RAT with newer Maven versions as methods from Maven v2 are deprecated. Minimum version of required Maven changed to 3.2.5. Thanks to Guillaume Nodet.
o RAT-317:  Change log output level of SCM ignore parser from info to debug in order to produce less log output in RAT runs. Thanks to Gary Gregory.
o RAT-314:  Add default recursive exclusion for maven-induced build artifacts in folder .mvn. Thanks to François Guillot.
o RAT-312:  Remove Travis build as it is unreliable. Builds with ASF Jenkins and Github Actions remain as before.
