              Apache Creadur Rat 0.15
                  RELEASE NOTES

The Apache Creadur Rat team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Creadur Rat 0.15

Apache Rat is a release audit tool. It improves accuracy and efficiency when checking
releases. It is heuristic in nature: making guesses about possible problems. It
will produce false positives and cannot find every possible issue with a release.
Its reports require interpretation.

In response to demands from project quality tool developers, Rat is available as a
library suitable for inclusion in tools. This POM describes that library.
Note that binary compatibility is not guaranteed between 0.x releases.

Apache Rat is developed by the Apache Creadur project, a language and build
agnostic home for software distribution comprehension and audit tools.

This release fixes a warning during site builds and updates various dependencies.

Changes in this version include:

Fixed Bugs:
o RAT-309:  Site builds could not be generated properly due to API changes: solution was to upgrade Maven Reporting API to 3.1.1 and use details of Maven Reporting Implementation 3.2.0 in RAT's Mojo hierarchy. Thanks to Michael Osipov, Gary Gregory.
o RAT-309:  Updated internal data structures from deprecated ArrayStack to JDK's ArrayDeque.
o RAT-306:  Add note about hierarchy of changelogs in RAT project structure when publishing the project webpage.
o RAT-307:  Update to focal (Ubuntu 20.04) on Travis to circumvent build errors and be able to use more modern JDK versions. Deprecate openJDK8 build with focal as it is not supported on Travis.
