Rat 0.12
========

 * We now require Maven 3.0.5+ to build Rat, but as before we only require
   Maven 2.2.1+ if you want to use Rat in your own Maven projects.
 * We've integrated Rat into the ASF Jenkins to ensure continuous builds with various JDK versions.
 * Issues resolved (see https://issues.apache.org/jira):

                  Supported source code management systems are: SVN, Git, Bazaar, Mercurial and CVS.
                  An ignore-file's contents is taken as it is without parsing or validating.
