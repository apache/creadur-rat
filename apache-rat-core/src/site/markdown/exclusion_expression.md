# Rat Exclusion Expressions

Rat uses a variation on the Ant or Git exclusion syntax.

* `?` matches a single character.  For example 'ca?' will match 'cat' and 'can' but not 'call' or the abbreviation for california  (or Canada) 'CA'.
* `*` matches zero or more characters. For example 'ca*' will match 'cat', 'can', 'call' and the abbreviation for california  (or Canada) 'CA'.
* `**` matches zero or more directories.  For example '**/ca?' will match 'my/cat', 'my/can', 'the/cat', 'the/can', 'cat' and 'can'.
* `!` reverses the meaning of the expression.  Example "!ca?" will not match "cat" or "can".  See include/exclude notes below.

The table below shows an example of how the `*` and `**` differ and interact.

|             | `foo/x/y` | `b/foo` | `b/foo/x` | `a/b/foo` | `foo` | `a/b/foo/x/y` | `a/b/foo/x` | `foo/x` | `b/foo/x/y` |

## Inclusion/Exclusion Notes

Patterns that are excluded may be superseded by patterns that are included.

For example: the exclusion pattern 'ca*' used in conjunction with the include 'cat' would result in the file 'cat' being included but 'can', 'call' and the abbreviation for california (or Canada) 'CA' being excluded.

When processed a negated exclusion results in an inclusion, and a negated inclusion results in an exclusion.

**Once a file is explicitly included it can not be excluded.**

## Directory separation characters

Patterns may use either '/' or '\\' as the path separation character. '/' is recommended.

## Case sensitivity

The case sensitivity of the matching patterns depends upon the file system in use.  If the file is case-sensitive then the matches are case-sensitive.
