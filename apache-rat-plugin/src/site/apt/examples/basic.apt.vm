Basic use

  Basic use means that you configure the plugin from the POM.
  However, it doesn't run automatically, but on demand:

------------------------------------------------------------------
  mvn apache-rat:check
------------------------------------------------------------------

  To achieve that, a section like the following needs to be
  added to your POM:

------------------------------------------------------------------
  <build>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.rat</groupId>
        <artifactId>apache-rat-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${currentVersion}</version>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </build>
------------------------------------------------------------------
