Adding a report to the generated site

  The typical use case is that you want the plugin to run whenever you invoke

------------------------------------------------------------------
  mvn site
------------------------------------------------------------------

  That way, the report will be added to the generated
  site. This is done by simply adding the following section to
  your POM:

------------------------------------------------------------------
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.rat</groupId>
        <artifactId>apache-rat-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${currentVersion}</version>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
