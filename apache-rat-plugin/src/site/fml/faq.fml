    <faq id="what">
      <question>What is RAT?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Basically, you can think of it as a tool that checks,
          whether you're source files are carrying proper
          license headers. Almost any non-trivial organization
          has a policy for license headers. In the case
          of the <a href="https://www.apache.org/">Apache Software
          Foundation (ASF)</a>, this is the
          <a href="https://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html">ASF
          Source Header and Copyright Notice Policy</a>.

    <faq id="where">
      <question>Where do I find Apache RAT?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Apache RAT is now part of the
          <a href='https://creadur.apache.org'>Apache Creadur</a> project,
          a home for all sorts of software that helps audit and review
          software distributions.

    <faq id="why">
      <question>Why should I use the Maven plugin to run Apache RAT?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>Because it makes running RAT trivial. Basically, you just
          add the plugin to the <code>build/plugins</code> section
          of your POM and run <code>mvn apache-rat:check</code>. Using RAT
          cannot be simpler.

      <question>
        The apache-rat-plugin creates a report for every subproject.
        I want a single report for the whole project, which includes
        the subprojects.
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>Set the configuration parameter "excludeSubProjects"
          to false.</p>

    <faq id="customLicense">
      <question>Can I use RAT to validate against a custom license header?</question>
