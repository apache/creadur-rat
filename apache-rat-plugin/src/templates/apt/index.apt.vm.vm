 The RAT Maven Plugin
 ------

Apache RAT&#8482; Overview

 RAT audits software distributions, with a special interest in headers.
 If this isn't quite what you're looking for then take a look at the
 other products developed by {{{https://creadur.apache.org}Apache Creadur}}&#8482;,
 including {{{https://creadur.apache.org/whisker}Apache Whisker}}&#8482; which audits
 and generates legal (for example <<<LICENSE>>>) documents for
 complex software distributions.

 The <<<apache-rat-plugin>>> is used to run RAT in the Maven environment. It
 executes RAT report while providing standard Maven configuration options.

 There are several things to keep in mind when running RAT

 [[1]] RAT highlights possible issues.

 [[2]] RAT reports require interpretation.

 [[3]] RAT often requires some tuning before it runs well against a project.

 [[4]] RAT relies on heuristics: it may miss issues

Usage

  The RAT Maven plugin has two basic features.

  <<<apache-rat:check>>> will generate a report as a simple text file, called <<<target/rat.txt>>>. This report contains
  the report as specified by the options specified.

  <<<apache-rat:report>>> will add the report to the generated site.

* Writing the report to a text file

  The <<<apache-rat:check>>> goal creates a text file with the report.
  This is done by adding a section like the following to the <<<pom.xml>>>:

------------------------------------------------------------------
  <build>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.rat</groupId>
        <artifactId>apache-rat-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </build>
------------------------------------------------------------------

  Once the plugin is specified the report can be generated from the command
  line by simply typing:

------------------------------------------------------------------
  mvn apache-rat:check
------------------------------------------------------------------

  We have provided an example of {{{./examples/verify.html}running the plugin automatically}}.

* Adding the report to the generated site

  A section like the following must be added to the <<<pom.xml>>> to automatically generate the report when you
  run the <<<site>>> target.

------------------------------------------------------------------
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.rat</groupId>
        <artifactId>apache-rat-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
------------------------------------------------------------------

  Run the <<<site>>> target.

------------------------------------------------------------------
  mvn site
------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuration Options

  There are a number of {{{./mvn_options.html}configuration options}} available to configure RAT. These options
  are derived from the command line version of RAT and function the same way.

* Examples

  The following examples should provide a better understanding of some usages of the RAT Maven Plugin.

  * {{{./examples/basic.html}Basic use}} of the <<apache-rat:check>> goal.

  * {{{./examples/verify.html}Automatically running}} the <<apache-rat:check>> goal
    when the project is built.

  * Adding the report to the {{{./examples/site.html}generated site}}.

  * Applying a {{{./examples/custom-license.html}custom license}}.

Using SNAPSHOT versions

    In case you want to try out current development versions, you need to adapt your pom.xml in order to include the ASF snapshot repossitory:

------------------------------------------------------------------
    <pluginRepositories>
        <pluginRepository>
            <id>apache.snapshots</id>
            <url>https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
                <updatePolicy>always</updatePolicy>
                <checksumPolicy>warn</checksumPolicy>
            </snapshots>
        </pluginRepository>
    </pluginRepositories>
------------------------------------------------------------------
