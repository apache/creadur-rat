About Apache Rat&#8482;

 Rat audits software distributions, with a special interest in headers.
 If this isn't quite what you're looking for then take a look at the
 other products developed by {{{https://creadur.apache.org}Apache Creadur}}&#8482;,
 including {{{https://creadur.apache.org/whisker}Apache Whisker}}&#8482; which audits
 and generates legal (for example <<<LICENSE>>>) documents for
 complex software distributions.

* Running from the Command Line

 Run from the command line with:

+------------------------------------------+
java -jar apache-rat/target/apache-rat-${project.version}.jar --help
+------------------------------------------+

 This will output a help message detailing the command line
 options available to you.

* Adding license headers

 Rat can be used to automatically add license headers to
 files that do not currently have them. Only files that
 are not excluded by the Rat configurations will be affected.

 To add license headers use a command such as:

+------------------------------------------+
java -jar apache-rat/target/apache-rat-${project.version}.jar --addlicense
  --copyright "Copyright 2008 Foo" --force
  /path/to/project
+------------------------------------------+

 This command will add the license header directly to the
 source files. If you prefer to see which files will be
 changed and how then remove the "--force" option.

* Using multiple excludes from a file

  It is common to use the Rat with the Maven or Ant plugins and specify
  a series of files to exclude (such as a README or version control
  files).  If you are using the Rat application instead of a plugin you
  can specify a series of regex excludes in a file and specify that with
  the -E option.

+------------------------------------------+
java -jar apache-rat/target/apache-rat-${project.version}.jar
 -E /path/to/project/.rat-excludes
 -d /path/to/project
+------------------------------------------+

** Styling output
 
 Rat allows you to style the output as you see fit.  Three stylesheets are included in the rat package.
 
  * plain-rat  The default stylesheet.
  
  * unapproved-licenses  Lists only the files with unapproved licenses.
  
  * missing-headers  List only files that are missing headers.
   
 These stylesheets can be specified using options in the command line, Maven or Ant clients.
