# Creadur RAT Migration Guide - Release 0.18

Release 0.18 is an intermediate release as we are working on big architectural changes within the 1.0.0 feature development.
In order to use release 0.18 you need to run with at least Java 17 as we finally dropped the Java 8 support in this release.

## General

* [RAT-478](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RAT-478) raised the Java language level to 17! We recommend running with Java 21, due to an existing problem in the JDK to generate RAT's Javadoc (tracked via [RAT-497](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RAT-497)).
* [RAT-478](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RAT-478) introduced the possibility to allow setting default charsets when processing files. We use ```UTF-8``` to read configuration and exclusion definition files instead of the system encoding in pre-0.18 releases.

## Maven

* [RAT-508](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RAT-508) reduced the logging output of exclusion parsers and the exclusion engine. If you want to see these messages run with ```-X``` or use the ```<verbose>true</verbose>``` option in your pom.xml or ```-Drat.verbose=true``` on the command line.
