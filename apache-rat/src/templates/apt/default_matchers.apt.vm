Default Matcher Definitions

 RAT provides a number of matcher definitions. These definitions are sufficient to define most licences. Additional
 matchers can be created and installed in the system. The listing below is the set of standard matchers.

#foreach ($matcher in $rat.matchers)

* ${matcher.name}

  $rat.aptEscape(${matcher.description})

  #if ($matcher.enclosed)
  * Encloses one ${matcher.enclosed.collection}${matcher.enclosed.type} object\(s\). ($matcher.enclosed.required)

  #end
  #if ($matcher.attributes)
  * <<Attributes>>

    #foreach ($attribute in $matcher.attributes)
    * <<${attribute.name}>> (${attribute.required}) ${rat.aptEscape(${attribute.description})}

      * type: ${attribute.type}

    #end
  #end
#end
