This file is also used by the maven-changes-plugin to generate the release notes.
Useful ways of finding items to add to this file are:

1.  Add items when you fix a bug or add a feature (this makes the
release process easier :-).

2.  Do a JIRA search for tickets closed since the previous release.
  https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/RAT?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:release-page

To generate the release notes from this file:

mvn changes:announcement-generate -Prelease-notes [-Dchanges.version=nn]
then tweak the formatting if necessary
and commit.
Run with changes.version-parameter in order to not generate a SNAPSHOT changelog

    Please list action attributes in the following order:
    issue - required
    type - required
    the rest are optional; order not important

    having the issue number first makes it easier to read the XML outline

If you wonder which action types are available:
https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-changes-plugin/xsd/changes-1.0.0.xsd

The <action> type attribute can be one of:

 * add: added functionality to the project.
 * fix: bug fix for the project
 * update: updated some part of the project.
 * remove: removed some functionality from the project.

          Added ability to specify the level of reporting on STANDARD files within a project.  This necessitated an addition
          of a command line option "standard" to limit specify the level of detail in the STANDARD file reporting.  See command line
          help for more details.  By default, there is no change in the reporting and only the presence of archives are reported.

          Change also fixed a major issue in license sorting.  Resulting in a change in order and expanding the name space for licenses.
          Licenses now must have a unique id within the family name space. (e.g. family1/one is different from family2/one).

        of a command line option "archive" to limit specify the level of detail in the archive report.  See command line
        help for more details.  By default, there is no change in the reporting and only the presence of archives are reported.

        This change also marked as deprecated the "-a", "--dir" and command line options.

        This change also marks an architecture change from processing Files to processing Documents in order to facilitate

    <release version="0.16.1" date="2024-01-24" description=
"As release 0.16 introduced breaking changes concerning the configurability of the Maven plugin, these configuration options are reintroduced albeit as deprecated elements.
You need to adapt your configuration in contrast to pre-0.16 settings: please consult our webpage for more details and examples.

Apart from dependency updates the release contains new features in .gitignore-parser and reduces log spam of RAT.

The most important bugfix relates to performance issues (due to expensive regex scanning) in combination with the Copyright-matcher and SPDX-detection.

All feedback was used to overhaul the homepage to include how to configure custom licenses and matchers.

We migrated to jUnit5 and removed the 'apache-rat-api' module in this release.
