* About Rat

** What Is Rat?

 Apache Rat is a release audit tool, focused on licenses.

** Rat Is Used To...?

 Use Rat to improve accuracy and efficiency
 when checking releases for licenses.

** Why Develop Rat?

 Reviewing releases in the {{{https://incubator.apache.org/}Apache Incubator}}
 by hand was error-prone and time-consuming.

 Rat arises from the Apache style, but is used more widely.
 If your release style isn't supported,
 {{{./mailing-lists.html}talk to us}}.

** How Do I Use Rat?

 Apache Rat ${project.version} ships with tooling for

   * {{{https://ant.apache.org/}Apache Ant}},

   * {{{https://maven.apache.org}Apache Maven}} and

   * the command line.

 Rat is extensible. If your build tool isn't supported, please contribute a
 {{{./issue-management.html}patch}} or
 {{{./mailing-lists.html}talk to us}}.

 Rat aspires to be self documenting. Please contribute a
 {{{./issue-management.html}patch}} or
 {{{./mailing-lists.html}talk to us}}
 whenever Rat falls short.
 
** How do I extend Rat
 
 There are several standard ways to extend Rat.
 
   * Add a {{{./license_def.html}license definition}} via an XML file.
   
   * Add a new {{{./matcher_def.html}Matcher definition}}. Requires Java expertise.
   
   * Add a new definition format.  Requires Java expertise as well as expertise with the format.

   * Write a new {{{./xslt_def.html}output report}}.  Requires XSLT knowledge.

   * Write a new {{{./ui_def.html}user interface}}.  Requires Java expertise, but there are tools to help.

** Who Develops Rat?

  Apache Rat is part of the {{{https://creadur.apache.org}Apache Creadur}}
  language- and build-agnostic suite of tools for auditing and comprehending
  software distributions. Our community develops
  {{{https://opensource.org/} open source software}} the
  {{{https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html} Apache way}}.

  Please feel free to contribute a
  {{{./issue-management.html}patch}},
  {{{https://wiki.c2.com/?TestDrivenDevelopment}demonstrate}} a
  {{{./issue-management.html}bug}}, or
  just
  {{{./mailing-lists.html}talk to us}}.
  All welcome :-)

* Quick Start: Running Rat

  There are three user interfaces for Rat: from the command line, from Ant, and from Maven.  All three of the interfaces
  support standard options as noted in the list below.

+------------------------------------------+
#include( "naming_help.txt" )
+------------------------------------------+

** Command Line

 To run from the command line enter the following command:

+------------------------------------------+
java -jar apache-rat-${project.version}.jar [options] [Directory or Archive]
+------------------------------------------+

 Where "[options]" are one or more of the options listed in for CLI int the table above, and "[Directory or Archive]" is the directory or archive you want to process.
 There is more detailed information found in the {{{./apache-rat/index.html}CLI documentation}}.

** Apache Ant

 Ant support is provided via a task library.  This requires {{{https://ant.apache.org/}Apache Ant 1.7}} or later.  The {{{./apache-rat-tasks/index.html}Ant library documentation}}
 provides detailed information concerning how to load the library and how to use the custom elements and properties for the Rat tasks.

** Apache Maven

 To use Maven the Rat Maven plugin must be used.  The plugin supports {{{https://maven.apache.org}Apache Maven}} ${mavenVersion} or later.

 <<ATTENTION!>> Maven4 is based on Java 17 and thus cannot be used with RAT, that relies on Java 8.

 To use the plugin add the following information to your pom file.

+------------------------------------------+
  <plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.rat</groupId>
    <artifactId>apache-rat-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
  </plugin>
+------------------------------------------+

 Detailed information about the {{{./apache-rat-plugin/index.html} Maven plugin}} is available.

** Styling output

 Rat allows you to style the output as you see fit.  Three stylesheets are included in the rat package.

  * {{{https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/creadur-rat/blob/master/apache-rat-core/src/main/resources/org/apache/rat/plain-rat.xsl}plain-rat}} - The default stylesheet.

  * {{{https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/creadur-rat/blob/master/apache-rat-core/src/main/resources/org/apache/rat/unapproved-licenses.xsl}unapproved-licenses}} - Lists only the files with unapproved licenses.

  * {{{https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/creadur-rat/blob/master/apache-rat-core/src/main/resources/org/apache/rat/missing-headers.xsl}missing-headers}} - List only files that are missing headers.

 These stylesheets can be specified using options in the command line, Maven or Ant clients.

 In addition, new {{{/xslt_def.html}stylesheets may be developed}} and applied to create new reports.

** Standard license and matcher definitions.

  Rat ships with a number of licenses, license families, adn matcher definitions.  Additional definitions/implementations of these objects may be added to the system.
  The list of standard libraries is available from the user interface and is listed below:

+------------------------------------------+
#include( "license_help.txt" )
