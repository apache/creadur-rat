* About Rat

** What Is Rat?

 Apache Rat is a release audit tool, focused on licenses.

** Rat Is Used To...?

 Use Rat to improve accuracy and efficiency
 when checking releases for licenses.

** Why Develop Rat?

 Reviewing releases in the {{{https://incubator.apache.org/}Apache Incubator}}
 by hand was error-prone and time-consuming.

 Rat arises from the Apache style, but is used more widely.
 If your release style isn't supported,
 {{{./mail-lists.html}talk to us}}.

** How Do I Use Rat?

 Apache Rat ${project.version} ships with tooling for

   * {{{https://ant.apache.org/}Apache Ant}},

   * {{{https://maven.apache.org}Apache Maven}} and

   * the command line.

 Rat is extensible. If your build tool isn't supported, please contribute a
 {{{./issue-tracking.html}patch}} or
 {{{./mail-lists.html}talk to us}}.

 Rat aspires to be self documenting. Please contribute a
 {{{./issue-tracking.html}patch}} or
 {{{./mail-lists.html}talk to us}}
 whenever Rat falls short.

** Who Develops Rat?

  Apache Rat is part of the {{{https://creadur.apache.org}Apache Creadur}}
  language- and build-agnostic suite of tools for auditing and comprehending
  software distributions. Our community develops
  {{{https://opensource.org/} open source software}} the
  {{{https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html} Apache way}}.

  Please feel free to contribute a
  {{{./issue-tracking.html}patch}},
  {{{http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestDrivenDevelopment}demonstrate}} a
  {{{./issue-tracking.html}bug}}, or
  just
  {{{./mail-lists.html}talk to us}}.
