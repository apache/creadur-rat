How to define new Rat reports

 All Rat reports are {{{https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/}XSLT stylesheets}} that transform the XML output.  The {{{https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-1/}schema}} for the XML output can be found in the
 {{{https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/creadur-rat/blob/master/apache-rat-core/src/main/resources/org/apache/rat/rat-report.xsd}
core resources rat-report.xsd file.}}

 There are three internal reports in the same directory that can also be used as examples:

 * {{{https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/creadur-rat/blob/master/apache-rat-core/src/main/resources/org/apache/rat/plain-rat.xsl}
plain-rat.xsl}}: The default report.

 * {{{https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/creadur-rat/blob/master/apache-rat-core/src/main/resources/org/apache/rat/missing-headers.xsl}
missing-headers.xsl}}: A report that lists files that do not have headers.

 * {{{https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/creadur-rat/blob/master/apache-rat-core/src/main/resources/org/apache/rat/unapproved-licenses.xsl}
unapproved-licenses.xsl}}: A report that lists files with unapproved licenses.

* The Report XML

 The apache-rat sub-module has an example of
 {{{https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/creadur-rat/blob/master/apache-rat/src/site/examples/rat-report.txt}the Rat report XML file.}}

** <<<rat-report>>> Element

 The XML document starts with a <<<rat-report>>> element that has a <<<timestamp>>> attribute that contains the date and time the Rat report was
 created.  The <<<rat-report>>> only contains <<<resource>>> elements.

** <<<resource>>> Element

 There is one <<<resource>>> element for every file that was processed.  The <<<resource>>> may contain <<<license>>> and <<<sample>>> child elements.
 It has two attributes:

 * <<<name>>>: The name of the file.

 * <<<type>>>: The document type.  This is one of the <<<Document.Type>>> enum values.  The value is always in lower case.  For a complete
 list see the {{{https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/creadur-rat/blob/master/apache-rat/src/main/java/org/apache/rat/api/Document.java}Document.java}}
 file for a complete list of document types.

** <<<license>>> Element

 The <<<license>>> element is only found as a child of a <<<resource>>> element and may have a <<<notes>>> child element.  The <<<license>>> element has four elements:

 * <<<approval>>>: Specifies whether the license is approved.  Values are restricted to 'true' and 'false'.

 * <<<family>>>: The license family code.  This is always 5 characters long and may have spaces at the end.

 * <<<id>>>: The license id.  This is often the same as the license family code with trailing spaces removed, but may be other values.
 It is guaranteed to be unique within licenses.

 * <<<name>>>: The name of the license.  This is the human-readable name that was provided when the license was defined.

** <<<sample>>> Element

 The  <<<sample>>> element contains a <<<CDATA>>> block comprising the text that was processed when the <<<resource>>> was processed.

** <<<notes>>> Element

 The <<<notes>>> element contains a <<<CDATA>>> block comprising the text of any notes about the license that were provided when the license was defined.

* How to use the report

 Once an XSLT stylesheet has been developed it can be tested by running Rat and providing the full path to the XSLT stylesheet as the stylesheet
 argument for the client being used.  See Running Rat from the {{{./apache-rat/index.html}Command line}},
 {{{./apache-rat-plugin/index.html}Maven}}, or
 {{{./apache-rat-tasks/index.html}Ant}} for details.
